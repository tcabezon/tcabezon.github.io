            <br>
            <p>
                Parametric modeling has gained general appreciation among creative practitioners as it enables the
                synthesis of multiple design alternatives and solutions in the design space.
                Although creative practitioners prefer to visually or tangibly experiment with alternatives and
                variations of design representations, design exploration is challenging in the parametric design space
                as this iterative process focuses on the variation of these individual parameters, rather than on the
                relationship among them.
                <br><br>
                In this project, we propose a generative deep learning (DL) model, a variational AutoEncoder (VAE), to
                capture the morphological features of the output 3D shapes of the parametric model and use the extracted
                latent space—reduced-dimensionality vector space embeddings of data where similar points are closer to
                each other— for the clustering and visualization of the outputs. Latent spaces have been shown to
                capture interesting semantic properties and support data analysis and synthesis within a domain. We
                present here a set of computational methods that center around projecting object features into low
                dimensional latent representational spaces that are directly learned from data. This research aims to
                implement a system that reduces the effort involved in undestanding the parametric space by providing
                the user with a new way to look at data based on the exploration of the latent space.

            <p>
                To conduct this experiment a simple parametric model was designed, a parametric algorithm for pot
                generation. Similar to the handcraft of pottery wheel throwing, a simple bezier curve with three control
                points was turned around an axis to generate each 3D digital pots. This parametric algorithm was used to
                randomly generate the dataset that was later used to train the VAE, a total of 15.000 different 3D pots
                were generated.
                <br><br>
                Once the VAE is trained, the encoder is used to embed each of the pots into the latent space and analyze
                the captured features by the DL model. For a better visualization of the extracted features, a
                t-Distributed Stochasitc Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is used, a popular dimensionality-reduction
                algorithm for visualizing high-dimensional data sets, creating a a plot of the objects into a 2D space.
                At this point it is possible to evaluate that the DL model has not only learned the parameters, but the
                relationship between these parameters and their influence on the output morphological shape. Finally,
                the data points were later clustered using a Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise
                (DBSCAN) findind core samples of hight density and expanding clusters with them. This shows that the DL
                model was able to extract the features of each of the pots and understand the realtionship. This latent
                space clustering is compared with the parametric space showing that the first better captures the final
                shapes of the objects.
                <br><br>
                In this work, we found that the latent space generated by the training of the VAE extracts the
                relationship of the different parameters used to generate the objects it was trained with. This
                relationship between the final shapes allows creative practitioners to handle digital information of
                parametric models as a whole, instead of by the individual parameters. In this work, latent space
                exploration is proposed as an alternative way of looking at digital objects beyond the parametric space
                exploration for a better understanding of the design space.
