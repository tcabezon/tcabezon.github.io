                    I was born in Bilbao in 1996, a city in the north of Spain. I love to learn new things which always keeps me moving. I studied a Double Degree in Industrial Design Engineering and Mechanical Engineering at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM) and I am currently enrolled in a Master’s Degree in Computational Design at Carnegie Mellon University, a passion I discovered during my bachelor years., a passion I discovered during my bachelor years.

                    On this website some of the projects I have been working on in the last years are shown. There are school projects as well as personal ones. For me, design is not only my major, it is everything. I believe that design is necessary in every aspect of our lives as you will see.

                    I love travelling, meeting new cultures, people and art. Art in any of its representations. I would describe myself as passionate, resolutive, perfectionist, open-minded and very adaptative. When I have to explain what my profession is, I always say that I am a problem finder and solver, and that my work should make people’s life better and easier.

                    During my university years I have been an exchange student in Tongji University in Shanghai (course 2017-2018), Politecnico de Milano (fall semester 2018) and Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María de Chile (spring semester 2018).
