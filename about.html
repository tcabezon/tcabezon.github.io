                I was born in Bilbao, Spain, in 1996 — a city in the north known for its creativity and resilience. I have an insatiable curiosity and a constant drive to learn, which has taken me across disciplines, countries, and projects. I hold a Double Degree in Industrial Design Engineering and Mechanical Engineering from Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM) and a Master’s in Computational Engineering and Mathematics from Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC). In 2023, I graduated with a Master’s in Computational Design from Carnegie Mellon University — a passion I first discovered during my bachelor years — and moved to New York City to work at <a class="underline" href="https://www.zendaplatform.com/">Zenda</a> as a Lead Computational Designer / Full Stack Developer, where I am building the future of design tools, a lifelong dream of mine.

                On this website some of the projects I have been working on in the last years are shown. There are
                school projects as well as personal ones. For me, design is not only my major, it is everything. I
                believe that design is necessary in every aspect of our lives as you will see.

                This website showcases a selection of projects I’ve worked on in recent years — both academic and personal. For me, design is not just a profession; it is a lens through which I see the world. I believe in the balance between creativity and engineering as the key to solving problems and improving lives, always leaving space for progress and innovation. When asked what I do, I often say that I am both a problem finder and a problem solver, with the goal of making life better and easier for others.
                <br><br>
                My academic journey has taken me far from home, enriching my perspective at every step. I’ve been an exchange student at Tongji University in Shanghai (2017–2018), Politecnico di Milano (Fall 2018), and Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María in Chile (Spring 2018). These experiences have shaped not only my design philosophy but also my understanding of how culture, technology, and creativity intersect.
