            <p>
                In this project, we will explore coding and training of GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks). This
                assignment is divided into two
                parts: in the first part, we will implement a specific type of GAN designed to process images,
                called a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN). We’ll train the DCGAN to generate cats from samples of
                random noise. In the second part, we will implement a more complex GAN architecture called CycleGAN,
                which was designed for the task of image-to-image translation.
                We’ll train the CycleGAN to convert between different types of two kinds of cats (Grumpy and Russian
                Blue) and apples to oranges.

            <h2>Deep Convolutional GAN</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                or the first part of this assignment, we will implement a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) as introduced
                by <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf%C3" target="'_blanck">Radford et al</a>. A DCGAN is
                simply a GAN that uses a convolutional neural network as the discriminator, and a network composed of
                transposed convolutions as the generator. To implement the DCGAN, we need to specify three things: 1)
                the generator, 2) the discriminator, and 3) the training procedure. We will develop each of these three
                components in the following subsections.

            </p>
            <br>

            <h4>Discriminator</h4>

            <br>
            <p>

                The discriminator in this DCGAN is a convolutional neural network that has the following architecture:
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>


            <p>
                In each of the convolutional layers shown above, we downsample the spatial dimension of the input
                volume by a factor of 2. Given the input-output relation equation and that we use kernel size K = 4 and
                stride S =
                2, the padding for each convolution is:
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <p>
                Bellow a summary of the discriminator implemented can be seen. The sizes of the outputs of
                each layer can be seen as well as the number of parameters that were trained. After each
                convolution operation, ReLU activation has been used a except from the last layer, the 5th
                Conv2d layer.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>

            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>Generator</h4>

            <br>

            <img src="images/cats/generator.png" class='  d-block float-center mx-auto d-block img-fluid col-10'>
            <br>


            <br>


            <p>
                The generator of the DCGAN consists of a sequence
                of transpose convolutional layers(we will implement upsampling and posterior conv2d) that progressively
                upsample the input noise sample to generate a fake image.
                <br><br>
                Before each of the convolutional layers shown above, we upsample the spatial dimension of the input
                volume by a factor of 2. Given the input-output relation equation and that we use kernel size K = 3 and
                stride S =
                1, the padding for each convolution is:

            <p>
                Bellow a summary of the generator implemented can be seen. The sizes of the outputs of
                each layer can be seen as well as the number of parameters that were trained. After each
                convolution operation, ReLU activation has been used a except from the last layer that used a Tanh
                activation.

            <h4>Training the loop</h4>

            <br>



            <p>
                Next, we implemented the training loop for the DCGAN. A DCGAN is simply a GAN with a specific type of
                generator and discriminator; thus, we train it in exactly the same way as a standard GAN. The
                pseudo-code for the training procedure is shown below.

            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>Results</h4>

            <br>

            <p>
                To train the DCGAN we have used basic (normalization) and deluxe data augmentation techniques (random
                crop and
                horizontal flips).In the following plots, we
                can see the influence of the data augmentation techniques. One of the main problems when training GANs
                is overfitting, this occurs when the data used for trainning is so small that the model memorizes it,
                which deteriorates the performance. Therefore, using data augmentation techniques increases the number
                of training examples improving the the training.

            <p>
                To further improve the data efficiency of GANs, we have also applied differentiable augmentations
                discussed in this <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.10738.pdf" target="'_blanck">paper</a>. In the
                plots bellow we can see the influence of this tecnique. The discriminator loss is higher this time, as
                it is more difficult to differentiate real images from the fake ones, which also makes the
                generator loss to reduce.

            <h2>CycleGAN</h2>
            <br><br>

            <p>
                In the second part of this assigment, we are going to implement a CycleGAN as introduced
                by <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10593.pdf" target="'_blanck">Zhu et al</a>. CycleGANs are
                particularly interesting because they allow to use un-paired training data. This means that in order
                to train a model to translate images from domain X to domain Y , we do not have to have exact
                correspondences
                between individual images in those domains as it is the case for image-to-image translation.
            </p>

            <br>
            <p>

                The generator in the CycleGAN has layers that implement three stages of computation:
                <br><br>
                1) the first stage
                encodes the input via a series of convolutional layers that extract the image features;
                <br>2) the second stage then transforms the features by passing them through one or more residual

                stage decodes the transformed features using a series of transposed convolutional layers, to build an

                of a convolutional layer, where the input is added to the output of the convolution. This is done so
                that the characteristics of the output image (e.g., the shapes of objects) do not differ too much from
                the input.

            <h4>PatchDiscriminator</h4>
            <br>

            <p>
                CycleGAN adopts a patch-based discriminator. Instead of directly classifying an image to be real or
                fake, it classifies the patches of the images, allowing CycleGAN to model local structures better. To
                achieve this effect, we reduce the spatial outputs to a dimension of 4x4 instead of a
                scalar, 1x1, as before.

            <br>



            <p>
                To train the CycleGan we implement the following training procedure:

            <h4>Cycle Consistency</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                The most interesting idea behind CycleGANs (and the one from which they get their name) is the idea of
                introducing a cycle consistency loss to constrain the model. The idea is that when we translate an image
                from domain X to domain Y, and then translate the generated image back to domain X, the result should
                look like the original image that we started with. The cycle consistency component of the loss is the
                mean squared error between the input images and their reconstructions obtained by passing through both
                generators in sequence (i.e., from domain X to Y via the X->Y generator, and then from domain Y back to
                X
                via the Y->X generator). The cycle consistency loss for the Y->X->Y cycle is expressed as follows:
            </p>

            <h4>Results</h4>
            <br>

                In the following image we can see the influence of the cycle consistency loss in the output results. In
                the first two images the results of training from domain X to Y and viceversa with and withouth cycle
                consistency are shown:

            In the previous image we can seee that introducing the cycle consistency loss improves the results, and
            reduces the visual artifacts. Therefore, the second training, with cycle consistency loss, has been
            continued until 10000 iterations. The results can be seen bellow:

            In the following experiments, we can compare the previous results, using PatchDiscriminator, with the
            results using the previous DCDiscriminator. We can see that the PatchDiscriminator, another of thee
            differences between DCGAN and CycleGAN improves the results for domain transformation.

            I think it is very interesting that in the orange dataset, there are a lot of images of the open fruit,
            however, in the apple dataset they are very little. Furthermore, oranges are orange in the inside, so same
            color inside as outside, but apples, are white in the inside. The problem has trouble learning this an in
            the results we can see apples that are red on the inside. Another thing that catched my atttention, was that
            the big mayority of the apples are red, so when the model sees a green apple, it doesn't convert it into an
            orange.

            If I was going to create a dataset to train a GAN it couldn't be any other than the queen of the selfies. To
            train this GAN I collected a dataset of 148 images of her intagram:

                I didn't manage to do train a good GAN for Kim K because of the small dataset I generated (or maybe because she is so unique and irrepliclable 😜). Also, I
                realized, that as we commented in class, the images should have been better preprocessed, for example,
                aligning the face in all the training images.
